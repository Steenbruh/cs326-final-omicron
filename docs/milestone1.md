# Gaming at UMass - Team Omicron
## Team Overview
John Steenbruggen - Steenbruh

John Rand - johnrandd241
## Part 1
## Innovative Idea
This application is designed to bring together gamers in the UMass community. The site will essentially serve as a hub, where users can see upcoming events, meet new gaming partners, and discuss strategy.  It is a lot like most social media apps in the sense that users can create customized profiles, message each other directly, and post about their interests, but with a focus on organizing events and meetups for the UMass gaming community.
## Important Components
The main component will be the bulletin, where advertisements for tournaments and meetups are posted. Posts made on the bulletin can be sorted through according to their tags, event date, or game. Other important features will include the messaging system, general discussion section, and the bracket creator for tournaments.
